Team ARES Robotics is a group of young engineering undergraduates from Netaji Subhash University of Technology that represents India in various International Competition like URC (University Rover Challenge) and ERC (European Rover Challenge). 
Our team consists of students, highly interested in the field of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence and having an aim of designing and fabricating a fully functional Rover that can be used in the early exploration of the Mars.
Our projects required students having various skills and interests, that makes our team divide into 5 major sub teams (Software, Electronics, Mechanical, Science and Business).
Recently we qualified for the European Rover Challenge and were among the top 50 teams all over the world.
