Project Manager is the backbone of every project. Therefore it’s no secret that effective project management is one of the most vital aspects to a sustained growth They are anchors that the whole project relies on, and if they can not delegate responsibility, the project inevitably encounters that fate. There are restrictions on funds, time, resources, project managers need to act within this limit in order to reliably meet the expectations. Otherwise, the project can intervene.

Project teams comprise people from heterogeneous backgrounds, all of whom have different personal agendas and goals. Therefore to obtain maximum efficiency and the best possible results organizations require a decentralized system of working. Team competitions are like a football match, where even you if have the best player you need not succeed, you need to have a balance and contribution from all the members and have confidence and trust on one other.

The cycle of a project comprises of four stages, defining, planning, executing and meeting the expectations. All these steps require hours of brainstorming to accommodate all the needs and create a perfect balance between resources and the outcome. The project manager is the person who would handle these functions and motivate the team to help in the process.

Great project management means much more than keeping project management’s iron triangle in check, delivering on time, budget, and scope. It means to create a vision for a successful project and gets everyone on the same page of what’s needed to stay on track for success. Oftentimes, the foresight to take such an approach is what differentiates good project management from bad. Breaking up into smaller chunks of work enables teams to remain focused on clear objectives, gear their efforts towards achieving the ultimate project goal through the completion of smaller steps and to quickly identify risks since risk management is important in project management.

Within a project team, it is extremely important to ensure that members are co-operating on a personal level before trusting them with a business-critical assignment. For instance, having a team member under pressure from their peers during project development could lead to that member not putting their full effort into their work, as they are feeling oppressed and unable to perform for fear of reprisals. In these scenarios, a personal connection and effective communication is the solution. 

Projects Managers are not only about managing changes but also managing inter-personal relationships and also managing uncertainty. From sure-shot goals to meticulously planned assumptions all the factor affect the growth and output of the organization thus each step has to be well-crafted. Nevertheless from personal experience, projects usually have a straightforward command and control structure, however the challenge arises when expectations are not met and we as humans look for someone to put the blame. In such times the responsibility of a leader is greater than ever to keep the team together and maintain a sense of authority and trust among the members. Rising from a failure is sweeter than an unsung success.
