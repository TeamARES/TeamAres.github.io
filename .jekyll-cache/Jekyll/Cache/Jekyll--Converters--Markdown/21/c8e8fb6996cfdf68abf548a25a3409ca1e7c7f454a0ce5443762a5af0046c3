I"£<p>It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing:</p>

<p>In the book it said: ‚ÄúBoa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without
chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the
six months that they need for digestion.‚Äù</p>

<p>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some
work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my Ô¨Årst drawing. 
My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/sticker-mule.jpg" alt="Drawing Number One" /></p>

<p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
drawing frightened them.</p>

<p>But they answered: ‚ÄúFrighten? Why should any one be frightened by a
hat?‚Äù</p>

<p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor
digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it,
I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the
grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.</p>
